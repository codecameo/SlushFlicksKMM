# SlushFlicksKMM


SlushFlicks has been built upon public APIs from IMDB. This application helps users to view trending, popular, upcoming and top-rated movies and Tv shows and their detailed information. Users can also search for a movie or Tv show. This app also cache data to support offline browsing. This is a personal project and the core objective of this project was to have hands-on experience on recent Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile(KMM), Android jetpack library components like compose, navigation and MVI architecture.
